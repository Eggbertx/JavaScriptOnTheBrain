There are no multiple threads, no images, no file accesses and no pre-made UI components. It's all beginners' stuff.</p><p> If you are not familiar with this game, the object is to remove as many marbles as possible from the board. The only legal moves are horizontal or vertical jumps with one marble over another to an empty hole on the other side, whereupon the marble that was jumped over goes away. To move, just drag the marbles in some legal direction.</p>"
