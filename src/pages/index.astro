	<p>This site represents my attempt to recreate some of the Java applet games originally created by Karl H&ouml;rnell. Since common browser support for Java applets has been abandoned, the games on the site are unusable unless you are using a much much much older browser, like Netscape or pre-4.x versions of Firefox. Or Internet Explorer, god forbid.</p>
	<p>Instead of using Java, the games are rewritten and reimplemented using JavaScript, meaning some of them should be (somewhat) mobile compatible as well.</p>
	<p>Because of the impermanence of online content, especially on sites maintained by individuals not funded by major companies, old sites like Java on the Brain are susceptible to becoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_media">lost media</a>.</p>
